<h1>Steps to Product</h1>

<p>
    <strong>1.</strong> I created a new GitHub repository. <a href="http://github.com/haxequest/haxequest">(here)</a> <br />
    <strong>2.</strong> I created a new project in HaxeFlixel. <a href="https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/hello-world/">(here)</a> <br />
    <strong>3.</strong> I implemented the Haxe script interpreter. <br />
    <strong>4.</strong> I made a basic lesson to prove I could do it. <br />
    <strong>5 (current step).</strong> I'm making more lessons to comprehensively teach what I want to teach.
